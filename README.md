# wine_riot
riot image compressor (64bits version) wine installation.

This is a Riot x64 installer for linux, with the help of wine :)  
I know there are several very good images compressor for linux, even with some good guis, but at my opinion, nothing that beats Riot image compressor.  
This installer was designed for q4os trinity, but should work on any recent debian distro (maybe with some adjustements to the .desktop files).  

Instructions:

clone the repository, an cd to the wine_riot folder
set install_riot.sh executable: sudo chmod +x ./install_riot.sh
launch the installer: ./install_riot.sh
Enjoy.
